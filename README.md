# Project Boost (Fly A Rocket) Game Instructions

## Objective
The goal of the game is to navigate your rocket through various levels, avoiding obstacles and reaching the landing pad safely.

## Controls:

   - **Boost**: Press the `Space` key to activate the rocket's thrusters and boost upwards.
   - **Rotate Left**: Press the `A` key to rotate the rocket counterclockwise.
   - **Rotate Right**: Press the `D` key to rotate the rocket clockwise.

## Gameplay
   1. **Starting the Game**: The game starts with the rocket on the ground. Use the boost and rotation controls to navigate.
   2. **Avoid Obstacles**: Avoid hitting walls, moving hazards, and other obstacles. Colliding with them will cause the rocket to explode, and you will have to restart the level.
   3. **Landing**: Carefully land the rocket on the designated landing pad to complete the level. The landing must be gentle; otherwise, the rocket will crash.
## Levels
   - The game consists of multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty. The levels are located in the `levels` directory and are named `level_1.tscn`, `level_2.tscn`, `level_3.tscn`, and `level_4.tscn`.
